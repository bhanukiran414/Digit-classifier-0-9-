# Handwritten Digit Recognition with CNN

This project showcases a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model designed to predict handwritten digits from images using the **MNIST dataset**. It includes a Flask-based web application to interact with the model and make real-time predictions.

## 📦 **Project Overview**

- **Model**: A CNN trained on the MNIST dataset for digit classification.
- **Web Application**: Developed with Flask to provide a user-friendly interface for predictions.

## ⚙️ **Features**

- **Image Upload**: Upload images of handwritten digits for prediction.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Get instant results of the digit recognized by the model.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive design for ease of use.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pillow
- NumPy

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    It’s recommended to use a virtual environment. Install the required packages using:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download the Model**

    Make sure you have the trained model file `model.h5` in the project directory.

4. **Run the Application**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## 🌐 **Usage**

1. Navigate to the web application in your browser.
2. Upload an image of a handwritten digit (0-9).
3. Click "Predict" to get the digit recognized by the model.

## 📁 **File Structure**

- `app.py`: Main Flask application file.
- `model.h5`: Pre-trained CNN model file.
- `templates/`: Contains HTML files for the web application.
- `static/`: (If used) Contains static files like CSS and JavaScript.
